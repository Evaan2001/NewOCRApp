We'll create a web-app where users can upload a photo of a passport and extract the essential details! 
</h3>

<div align="center">

I was freelancing for a security company in Austin, TX, and was tasked to write code for an embedded device to extract someone's information from a photo of their passport. I took that software and created a web-app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) so that others can also use my work. Click here to [use my app](https://revisedocr.streamlit.app/)!

What Information Can We Get?
</h2>
 
<p  align="center">
Given a photo of a passport, my software can retrieve the following:
</p>
1) Issuing Country
2) Full Name
3) Passport Number
4) Date of Birth
5) Sex

1) The nvcc compiler, which stands for **Nv**idia **C**uda **C**ompiler
2) A Nvidia graphics card (sadly, this means no Macs released after 2015; I used the Nvidia Quadro K1200 GPU which sells for about $100)
